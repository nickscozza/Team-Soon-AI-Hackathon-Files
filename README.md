# AI-Hackathon - Project Continued: Enhancing Prompts to Improve Accuracy.

## Quick Definitions: 
What is an LLM?

A Large Language Model is an advanced artificial intelligence model designed to process and generate human-like text. These models, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5, have been trained on a vast amount of internet text to learn patterns, grammar, and factual information.

What are genetic algorithms?

In the context of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to engineer prompts, a genetic algorithm (GA) can be employed as a method for optimizing or evolving prompts to achieve specific objectives. 
## Step 1: Define the problem our project is solving:
In this case, the goal is to enhance the prompts used for a language model to improve the accuracy and context relevance of its responses.
## Step 2: Understand the Current System
The Current Large Language Model this project is using is Mistral AI (a.k.a Mistralai). 

- It is a pre-trained Deep Learning model (Meaning that it has been trained on large datasets to accomplish a specific task already.)

- Even though it is a pre-trained model, it can be used without modifying it or, if needed, customized to suit application requirements across industries (Accounting, healthcare etc.)
### About the LLM
- Mistral 7B v0.1 is a 7-billion-parameter language model focused on superior performance and efficiency.

- Mistral 7B outperforms Llama 2 13B in all evaluated benchmarks and surpasses Llama 1 34B in reasoning, mathematics, and code generation.

- The model incorporates grouped-query attention (GQA) for faster inference and sliding window attention (SWA) to handle sequences of arbitrary length efficiently and with reduced inference cost.

- What does grouped-query attention (GQA) and inference mean?

- What does sliding window attention (SWA) mean?



## Step 3: Define Fitness Function
Create a fitness function that evaluates the quality of a prompt and its corresponding response. The fitness function should quantify how well the language model performs based on the given prompt. For example, you can consider factors like relevance, correctness, and coherence.

## Step 4: Define Genetic Representation
Represent prompts as bitstrings. Each bit in the bitstring corresponds to a specific aspect or token in the prompt. Define a mapping that translates bitstrings into actual prompts that the language model can understand.

## Step 5: Implement the Genetic Algorithm
Use the provided genetic algorithm as a template. Integrate it with your language model and fitness function. Customize the genetic operations (crossover, mutation, insertion, deletion) to manipulate prompts effectively.

## Step 6: Initialization
Create an initial population of prompts (bitstrings). These prompts can be randomly generated or based on your domain knowledge. Ensure diversity in the initial population.

## Step 7: Evolution Loop
Run the genetic algorithm through multiple generations. In each generation:

Evaluate the fitness of each prompt-response pair using the defined fitness function.
Select the top-performing prompts based on fitness scores.
Apply genetic operations (crossover, mutation, insertion, deletion) to create a new generation of prompts.
Introduce new, random prompts for diversity.

## Step 8: Evaluate and Iterate
After the specified number of generations, evaluate the final population of prompts. Identify the prompts with the highest fitness scores. Test these optimized prompts with your language model.

If the performance is satisfactory, you've successfully enhanced the prompts. If not, consider refining the fitness function or adjusting genetic algorithm parameters, and repeat the process.

## Step 9: Results Analysis
Analyze the responses generated using the optimized prompts. Compare them with the initial responses to assess the improvement. Use qualitative and quantitative metrics to measure success.

## Step 10: Documentation and Deployment
Document the entire process, including the problem definition, algorithm parameters, and results. If the enhanced prompts yield significant improvements, deploy the optimized prompts in your language model for real-world applications.

### Important Note: Customize the steps based on your language model
Remember to customize the steps based on the specific characteristics and requirements of your language model and conversational AI system.
